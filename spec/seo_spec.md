# I took a SEO report in lighthouse and other website as well and it was awfull

## Need to make a plan for fixing SEO and performance optimization on the website

1. Lighthouse says performance is poor as 51% so need to optimize for each pages and its not like we have more public pages its like 5 pages only there is no dynamic generated public page so we can mange it.
2. SEO is poor as no meta tags for any pages like meta title, descriptions, favicon of all kind, social media support like og tag, json lds and everything possible in each pages which are non auth protected/public
3. Performance of pages is the key lighthouse score says FCP and LCP is poor, speed index is poor, Let me attach @spec/seo/lighthouse_mobile_report_pizza_space.pdf and @spec/seo/lighthouse.json you will see detailed report and analyze

## Give me detailed summary and what to be done for fixes and then we start fixing it
