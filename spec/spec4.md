# Need to create menu page

## What I want

1. I need an page where user can fully interact with menu
2. Need side bar we can have categories, and sub categories in accordion fashion apis are mentioned. mobile view can be different
3. Right section will handle product grid and its states like loading, success with data and error and empty states
4. Product grid should also have pagination as well as product API will be paginated
5. All API handling should be serverside like categoryId, subCategoryId, pagination and all for the SEO purpose
6. search input not needed as we already provide search in header
7. all state should handled by routes params so that user can share link of filters they apply and can find same products
8. filtering should be based on categories, subcategories, search and storeId (skip for now like we will handle from global store selector later in future)
9. SEO should be powerful for this page as it is main page of the website
10. UI should be eyecatchy and strong mobile responsive
11. UI should follow current design patterns
12. No build or runtime errors should be reflected and it should be handled properly

Use ref, shadcdn, 21st dev, playwright and my subagents to achieve this flow
