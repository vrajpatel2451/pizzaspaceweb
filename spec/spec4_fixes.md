# Need to fix these asap on menu page

1. Design guideline of heading of our menu is not upto the mark see any of sections heading in home page as design should be consistant
2. when select categories or any other filters does not show loader when APIs are fetching which is not good at all
3. error fallback or empty fallback of products does not align in middle

## PLEASE FOLLOW CURRENT DESIGN GUIDELINE.

## UI OF CURRENT MENU PAGE IS NOT UPTO THE MARK
