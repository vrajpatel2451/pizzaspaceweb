# Need product details fixes ASAP

1. Pricing is something different like see in product card and details in card it is showing 10 pounds and in details it is 0.10 pounds so something is wrong with that
2. Counter for quantity new version is not looking good previous was way much better
3. remove most ordered tag in variant/addons, required/optional in variantgroup/addongroups as we show description already
4. remove cooking request from dialog this is good component for cart screen so keep that component just remove it from current dialog
5. if u see in addon group we show 0/1 selected the count seems wrong try to fix it if not able to fix it please remove it.
6. Description section needs way much modification Let me give u layout
7. if multi image then dialog should have product slider

## Description section needs

1. remove veg chip as we already show in product photo.
2. Top section [NAME ---SPACER--- PRICE -- ACCORDION]
3. On Expand the current description should be shown but need changes on that
4. Description order :-
   --- DESCRIPTION
   --- SERVING INFO Person/dish size
   --- NUTRITIONAL INFO: no cards should be rich text like `out of 100g it contains 10g of protein` something like that
   --- SPICE LEVELS, FROSTING
   --- ALERGEN INFO
   --- INGREDIANT LIST

## Mobile Responsiveness

1. There is so much spacing around bottomsheet it self need to check on spacing which still not fixed if u do not able to match that then remove bottomsheet and keep dialog
2. Actions UI looks weird.
